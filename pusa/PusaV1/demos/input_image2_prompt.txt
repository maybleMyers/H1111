A continuous helmet-mounted POV shot shows us tailing a woman on a dirt bike as she races across rolling desert dunes. She kicks up golden sand in wide arcs, her tracks the only ones across the wind-sculpted landscape. The camera dips and jolts with each crest and drop. She rides solo, engine roaring against a cloudless sky. No one else is visible in the dunes. Just herâ€”blazing through the sunlit emptiness.
