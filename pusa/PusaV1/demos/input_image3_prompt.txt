A front-facing wide angle shot of two inflatable duck floaties. They drift toward each other until their beaks meet in a gentle kiss and then magically one of them closes his eyes. The moment takes place in a quiet backyard pool under warm afternoon sun, with calm water and tiled edges reflecting soft light. One floatie is slightly faded, with creases from long use; the other is bright yellow, glossy and new. As they float closer, their heads tilt subtly, and the space between their beaks, rounded heads, and arched necks forms an evident heart shape from this angle. Just as they touch, surprisingly each floatie magically winksâ€”one eye narrowing in a playful, synchronized gesture. The water stays nearly still, disturbed only by their closeness. Soft highlights ripple across their surfaces, and the pool glows in a warm, summery tone. Filmed in 16mm film.
