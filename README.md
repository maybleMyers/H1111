You will need to put the full wan fun control model in the wan\origin-VideoX-Fun\models\Diffusion_Transformer\Wan2.2-Fun-A14B-Control folder to make this work. It just automatically generates videos with the source backend and adds blockswap. It was also kind of difficult to install and you need to goto the wan/origin-videox-fun and install some things from there as well as the normal requirements. https://github.com/aigc-apps/VideoX-Fun/ is the source. It seems to not work great to be honest even after getting every thing working.
