This branch is in active development, so could break or change alot.  
You can find all of the files needed for wan2.2 at https://huggingface.co/maybleMyers/wan_files_for_h1111/tree/main  
so far all models work. you can use the t2v models by not using an input image in the wan2.2 tab.  

Put all the models in the wan subfolder. To run the 14B-i2v model you need these:  
wan/wan22_i2v_14B_low_noise_fp16.safetensors  
wan/wan22_i2v_14B_high_noise_fp16.safetensors  
wan/models_clip_open-clip-xlm-roberta-large-vit-huge-14.pth  
wan/Wan2.1_VAE.pth  
wan/models_t5_umt5-xxl-enc-bf16.pth
